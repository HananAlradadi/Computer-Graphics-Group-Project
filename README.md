# Computer graphics group project
## Project introduction
> The objective of this assignment is to gain some experience applying the computer graphics techniques discussed in the class. You will demonstrate your knowledge of these techniques in the context of an computer graphics application to draw a scene (or scenes) of your own design using JAVAFX. In our project, we designed a scene about nature. We used a picture of nature in the background. We created apples and some hot-air balloons in different places. We also surrounded the lake by grass. Finally, we put some effects and events that illustrate the idea of our project.
## Requirements  
> Your project should contain at least one instance of each topic covered during the labs:
> o Primitive shapes: points, lines, polygons, …etc.
> o 3d shapes: boxes, cylinders, teapots, cones, … etc. 
> o Colors: background, filling objects
> o Modeling/Camera transformation
> o Keyboard/ or mouse events 
> o Lighting 
> o Texture mapping
> o Reflection of light sources

## Project description
> - 2d shapes (Lines and Rectangle)
We Used line to Link between boxes and sphere of the hot-air 
balloons
And Rectangle to add an effect to the shape of the sphere We 
also rotated the edges of the rectangle.
> - 3d shapes (spheres, box, cylinder)
We used spheres and boxes shapes to make some hot-air 
balloons and map a texture for them. And to make an apple we 
used a sphere shape and mapping a texture. And box also to 
make the background of the window
And Cylinder to make the grass on the lake and also here 
mapping a texture.
